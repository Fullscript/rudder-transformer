## General Queries

### Event Ordering Required?

**Yes, event ordering is required** for Campaign Manager 360 conversions for the following reasons:

1. **Conversion Updates**: 
   - The `batchupdate` request type updates existing conversions
   - If events are processed out of order, you might update a conversion with stale data, overwriting newer information
   - This is especially critical when using enhanced conversions, as user identifiers might be updated over time

2. **Timestamp-based Processing**:
   - All conversions include a `timestampMicros` field that represents when the conversion occurred
   - Campaign Manager 360 uses this timestamp for attribution and reporting
   - Out-of-order events could lead to incorrect attribution windows and reporting discrepancies

3. **Conversion Counting**:
   - The `ordinal` field is used to deduplicate conversions
   - Processing events out of order might affect how conversions are counted and deduplicated

4. **Floodlight Activity Tracking**:
   - Conversions are tied to specific Floodlight activities
   - Sequential processing ensures that conversion funnels and user journeys are accurately represented

**Recommendation**: Maintain event ordering, especially for `batchupdate` operations and when tracking user conversion journeys.

### Data Replay Feasibility

#### What if data is missing & need to replay?

**Feasibility**: **Possible with considerations**

1. **Historical Data Replay**:
   - ✅ Campaign Manager 360 accepts conversions with past timestamps via `timestampMicros`
   - ✅ Can replay missing data by sending `batchinsert` requests with historical timestamps
   - ⚠️ **Consideration**: Check Campaign Manager 360's attribution window limits
   - ⚠️ **Consideration**: Historical conversions might affect reporting retroactively
   - ⚠️ **Consideration**: Ensure `ordinal` values are correct to avoid duplicate counting

2. **Replay Constraints**:
   - Must provide all required fields: `floodlightConfigurationId`, `floodlightActivityId`, `ordinal`, `timestampMicros`, `quantity`
   - Must provide at least one user identifier (gclid, matchId, mobileDeviceId, etc.)
   - Event ordering should be maintained during replay

3. **Best Practices for Replay**:
   - Use `batchinsert` for missing conversions
   - Maintain original `ordinal` values to prevent duplicate counting
   - Preserve original `timestampMicros` values
   - Replay in chronological order

#### What if data is already delivered & need to replay?

**Feasibility**: **Yes, using batchupdate**

1. **Update Existing Conversions**:
   - ✅ Use `batchupdate` request type to update already-delivered conversions
   - ✅ Can add enhanced conversion data to existing conversions
   - ✅ Conversions are identified by their unique combination of: `floodlightActivityId`, `ordinal`, and user identifier

2. **Replay/Update Scenarios**:
   - Adding enhanced conversion data (user identifiers) to existing conversions
   - Correcting conversion values
   - Updating custom variables
   - Note: Cannot update `childDirectedTreatment` and `limitAdTracking` in `batchupdate`

3. **Deduplication**:

    In Campaign Manager 360, duplicates are controlled by the ordinal on a conversion. If multiple conversions share the same Floodlight activity, Floodlight configuration, user identifier (e.g., encryptedUserId/gclid/dclid/matchId/mobileDeviceId), and timestamp, then:
   - Same ordinal: CM360 deduplicates and only one conversion is kept.
   - Different ordinals: CM360 treats them as distinct, and all are kept. ​
   - Campaign Manager 360 uses `ordinal` for deduplication
   - Same `ordinal` + `floodlightActivityId` + user identifier = same conversion (will be updated, not duplicated)

### Rate Limits and Batch Sizes

#### Batch Sizes

**Implemented Batch Limits**:
- **Maximum conversions per batch**: 1000 conversions
- **Constant**: `MAX_BATCH_CONVERSATIONS_SIZE = 1000`
- **Batching Strategy**: 
  - Events are grouped by request type (`batchinsert` vs `batchupdate`)
  - Each group is then chunked into batches of 1000 conversions
  - Separate API calls for each batch

#### API Rate Limits

**Default Quota Limits** (from [Campaign Manager 360 API Quotas](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/quotas)):
- **Queries Per Day**: 50,000 requests per project per day (can be increased)
- **Queries Per Second**: 1 QPS per project (default)
  - In Google API Console: "Queries per minute per user" = 60 (default)
  - Can be increased up to 600 (10 QPS maximum)
- **Daily Quota Refresh**: Midnight PST

**Endpoints Used**:
1. `POST /dfareporting/v4/userprofiles/{profileId}/conversions/batchinsert`
   - Batch size: Up to 1000 conversions
   - Rate limit: Subject to the quota limits above (50,000 requests/day, 1 QPS default)

2. `POST /dfareporting/v4/userprofiles/{profileId}/conversions/batchupdate`
   - Batch size: Up to 1000 conversions
   - Rate limit: Subject to the quota limits above (50,000 requests/day, 1 QPS default)
   - Additional constraint: Can only update existing conversions

**Requesting Additional Quota**:
- If you encounter `dailyLimitExceeded` error, you can request additional quota
- Navigate to Campaign Manager 360 API in Google API Console
- Review usage statistics and apply for higher quota if usage is legitimate
- Reference: [Requesting Additional Quota](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/quotas#additional_quota)

**Error Handling**:
- Retryable errors: All errors except `PERMISSION_DENIED`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, `NOT_FOUND`
- Non-retryable errors: `PERMISSION_DENIED`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, `NOT_FOUND`
- Implementation: `checkIfFailuresAreRetryable()` in `networkHandler.js`

### Multiplexing

**Multiplexing**: **No**

Campaign Manager 360 destination does not multiplex events. Each incoming track event results in a single conversion entry in the final batch payload.

**Flow**:
1. Input: 1 Track event
2. Processing: Validates and transforms event
3. Output: 1 Conversion object in the batch

**Note**: While multiple conversions are batched together, this is batching, not multiplexing. Each input event maps to exactly one output conversion.

## FAQ

### 1. How to handle encrypted user IDs?

If you have encrypted user IDs, set **Hash User Identifiers** to `false` in the destination configuration. This prevents RudderStack from hashing already-encrypted data.

Additionally, you must provide the encryption information:
- `encryptionEntityType`: The type of entity (e.g., `DCM_ACCOUNT`, `DCM_ADVERTISER`)
- `encryptionSource`: The source of encryption (e.g., `AD_SERVING`, `DATA_TRANSFER`)
- `encryptionEntityId`: The ID of the encryption entity

### 2. What's the difference between batchinsert and batchupdate?

- **batchinsert**: Used for inserting new conversions into Campaign Manager 360
- **batchupdate**: Used for updating existing conversions
  - Can add enhanced conversion data (user identifiers) to existing conversions
  - Cannot update `childDirectedTreatment` and `limitAdTracking` fields
  - Requires the conversion to already exist (identified by floodlightActivityId + ordinal + user identifier)

### 3. When should I use enhanced conversions?

Use enhanced conversions when:
- You want to improve conversion matching accuracy by providing user identifiers (email, phone, address)
- You're using `batchupdate` request type (required)
- You have first-party user data (email, phone, name, address)
- You want to enhance existing conversions with additional user matching signals

Enable **Enhanced Conversions** in the destination configuration and provide user identifiers in `traits` or `context.traits`.

### 4. How does deduplication work with ordinal values?

Campaign Manager 360 uses the `ordinal` field for deduplication. If multiple conversions share:
- Same Floodlight activity ID
- Same Floodlight configuration ID
- Same user identifier (gclid, matchId, etc.)
- Same timestamp

Then:
- **Same ordinal**: CM360 deduplicates and only one conversion is kept
- **Different ordinals**: CM360 treats them as distinct conversions, and all are kept

**Best Practice**: Use unique ordinal values (e.g., order ID, transaction ID) to ensure each conversion is tracked separately.

### 5. Can I send conversions for users without a gclid?

Yes! Campaign Manager 360 supports multiple user identifiers. At least one of the following must be provided:
- `gclid` (Google Click ID)
- `matchId` (Match ID)
- `dclid` (DoubleClick Click ID)
- `mobileDeviceId` (Mobile Device ID)
- `impressionId` (Impression ID)
- `encryptedUserId` (Encrypted User ID - requires encryption info)
- `encryptedUserIdCandidates` (Array of encrypted user IDs - requires encryption info)

### 6. What happens if a batchupdate fails because the conversion doesn't exist?

When a `batchupdate` request is made for a non-existent conversion:

1. **Response Structure**: The API response contains:
   - `hasFailures`: Boolean flag set to `true` if any conversions in the batch failed
   - `status[]`: Array with one `ConversionStatus` element per conversion (in the same order as the input)

2. **Error Code**: For a non-existent conversion, the status will indicate error code `NOT_FOUND`

3. **Retry Behavior**: According to Google's Enhanced Conversions documentation:
   - `NOT_FOUND` failures can and should be retried for up to 6 hours
   - This accounts for potential delays in conversion indexing/processing in Campaign Manager 360

4. **Implementation**: RudderStack's error handler treats `NOT_FOUND` as a non-retryable error for immediate failures, but the conversion might succeed if retried later (within the 6-hour window)

**Recommendation**: Ensure conversions exist in Campaign Manager 360 before attempting to update them with enhanced conversion data.
