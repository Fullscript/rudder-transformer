# Memory Bank Review and Questions

This document contains a review of the memory bank files, identifying areas that need reorganization, validation, or clarification. It also includes specific questions that require answers to improve the accuracy and completeness of the memory bank.

## Overall Structure Review

The memory bank is currently organized into the following files:

1. `README.md` - Overview and table of contents
2. `01_project_overview.md` - Project details and scope
3. `02_technical_stack.md` - Languages, frameworks, and tools
4. `03_system_architecture.md` - Components and relationships
5. `04_preferences_and_settings.md` - User preferences and system settings
6. `05_best_practices_and_guidelines.md` - Coding standards and patterns
7. `06_workflows_and_processes.md` - Development and deployment workflows
8. `07_code_structure.md` - Directory layout and code organization
9. `08_event_stream_pipeline.md` - Event Stream pipeline details
10. `09_integration_development_guide.md` - Guide for developing integrations
11. `10_system_dependencies.md` - Dependencies on other RudderStack components
12. `11_git_workflow_cicd.md` - Git workflow and CI/CD pipeline

### Structural Improvements Needed

1. **Potential Duplication**: There may be some overlap between `03_system_architecture.md` and `10_system_dependencies.md`. Consider merging or more clearly delineating the content.

2. **Logical Grouping**: Consider grouping files into categories (e.g., Project Information, Development Guidelines, Technical Details) for easier navigation.

3. **Cross-References**: Add more cross-references between related files to improve navigation.
