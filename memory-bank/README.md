## About RudderStack Transformer

RudderStack Transformer is a service that handles both source and destination integrations in the RudderStack ecosystem. It transforms data between different formats as needed:

1. For sources: It transforms data from external sources (like webhooks, cloud apps) into RudderStack's standard event format
2. For destinations: It transforms RudderStack events to destination-specific formats

It serves as a critical component in the RudderStack data pipeline, enabling data to flow bidirectionally between various sources and destinations by handling the necessary format transformations.

## Key Features

- Support for numerous destinations and sources
- Scalable architecture with clustering support
- Comprehensive monitoring and metrics
- Extensible through the Component Development Kit (CDK)
- Robust error handling and reporting
- High-performance event processing
